A portfolio of all the data science projects completed as a part of academics or as independent projects.

About me: My name is Fazal Mahmood and I am a recent graduate of University of Toronto (Canada). I recieved my B.Sc (Hons.) in Astrophysics from this university. As part of my academics I was required to do some comprehensive programming in Python for analysis of data from various sources, which is why I have decided to pursue a caree in Data Science as it suits my skill set the best.

In this repository, you will find various independent projects that I undertook on ly own time to showcase my tangible skill set better.
