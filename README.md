# Data-Science-Portfolio
A portfolio of all the data science projects completed as a part of academics or as independent projects.

CreditRisk_Classification: This project is a binary (good/bad) classification probelm and involves the use of Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and a Deep Neural Network. The first two classifiers were written using the scikit-learn libraries while the last one was written using the keras library in tensorflow. A maximum accuracy of 74.8% was achieved by the Random Forest Classifier which is significant as the maximum accuracy listed on openml.org for this dataset is roughly 78%. This project gives a good insight in the building and training process of the classifiers and compares the accuracy between them.
